Errors exist in your project


I'll scan the modified Dart files and pubspec for syntax or import errors. I'll read them to check for common mistakes.

I'll run flutter analyze in the project root to capture the exact analyzer errors.

-----------------------


flutter analyze

PS D:\Dev\Approval\approval> flutter analyze



------------
Result

The fatal analyzer error is resolved — flutter analyze now reports no errors (only infos/warnings).
Remaining messages are informational (e.g., use_build_context_synchronously, deprecation notes in admin_users_widget.dart) and do not prevent running the app.
How you can verify locally

cd d:\Dev\Approval\approval
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter run   # or `flutter run -d chrome` for web


----------------
Please test

Rebuild/run the app:

cd d:\Dev\Approval\approval\backend

flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run

python app.py

python init_db.py


Log in and open the profile menu — it should display First + Last name and "StaffNo - Nickname" when those fields exist in the backend.
If you still see email or a dash:

Confirm the backend users table has first_name, last_name, staff_no, and nickname populated for that account.
I can also update the app to proactively show a fallback (e.g., show 'Unknown' instead of '-') if you'd prefer. Which fallback would you like?

--------------------
cd d:\Dev\Approval\approval\backend

python app.py

-----------------


flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome

---------------
cd d:\Dev\Approval\approval\backend

flutter pub get
flutter run

merge the code change to GitHub


Option A — Quick GUI (recommended)

1. Push your branch:

    git checkout feature/approvals-page
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat(approvals): add Approvals page + Approval Center"
    git push -u origin feature/approvals-page

2. Open the repo on GitHub → you should see a "Compare & pull request" banner for your branch. Click it, paste the contents of PR_DESCRIPTION.md into the PR description, create the PR.
3. On the PR page click "Squash and merge" (or your team's preferred merge method) → confirm → optionally delete the branch.
4. Update local main:

    git checkout main
    git pull origin main


Option B — Using GitHub CLI (gh) (fast, from terminal)


1. Push branch:

    git push -u origin feature/approvals-page

2. Create a draft PR (this will open the web UI):

    gh pr create --base main --head feature/approvals-page --title "feat(approvals): add Approvals page + Approval Center with resizable three-column layout" --body-file PR_DESCRIPTION.md --draft --web

3. After review, merge the PR from CLI:

    gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch

4. Update local main:

    git checkout main
    git pull origin main


Option C — Merge locally (only use if you must merge without PR)

1. Ensure main is up-to-date:

    git checkout main
    git pull origin main

2. Merge feature branch (resolve conflicts if any):

    git merge --no-ff feature/approvals-page
    # fix conflicts if prompted, then:
    git add <fixed-files>
    git commit
    git push origin main

3. Delete branch:

    git branch -d feature/approvals-page
    git push origin --delete feature/approvals-page



-----------------------
Do this to fix it and push the real changes up.

#1. Go to the repo root and check status there

    cd D:\Dev\Approval\approval
    git status

#2. Stage all changes from the repo root (safe)

    git add -A

#3. Commit

    git commit -m "feat(approvals): add Approvals page + Approval Center and PR description"

#If commit says "nothing to commit", re-run git status to confirm files are present.

#4. Push the feature branch to origin

    git push -u origin feature/approvals-page


You should see output like:
To github.com:Khamvang/approval-system.git

- [new branch] feature/approvals-page -> feature/approvals-page
or an update to the existing branch.
Verify remotely (open in browser)


5. Branch list: https://github.com/Khamvang/approval-system/branches
- Compare: https://github.com/Khamvang/approval-system/compare/feature/approvals-page

If you want to merge to main now:

- Preferred: Create a PR on GitHub (use the PR_DESCRIPTION.md you added).
- Quick local merge (if you must):

    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    git merge --no-ff feature/approvals-page
    # fix conflicts if any, then
    git push origin main
    # delete branch locally and remotely if desired:
    git branch -d feature/approvals-page
    git push origin --delete feature/approvals-page



----------------
Please test

Rebuild/run the app:

cd d:\Dev\Approval\approval\backend

flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run

python app.py



----------------------
Pushing change to origin main GitHub


#To run git commands to inspect status, branch, and remotes.

    git status --porcelain; git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD; git remote -v


#stage, commit, and push the current branch to origin on GitHub.

    git add -A; git commit -m "Save changes"; git push origin main
