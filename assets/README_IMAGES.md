Place these image files in `assets/images/`:

- `lalco_logo.png` — LALCO logo shown at the top of the login card. Recommended size: 300×120 (PNG with transparent background).
- `bg.jpg` — background image (photo of a developer working/coding). Recommended size: 1920×1080 or larger.

After adding the images, run:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

Then rebuild the app. If you want different file names, update the paths in `lib/screens/login_page.dart` accordingly.
